Purpose of Application

Weather Weekly is an application that was developed for the local weather organization. Where the organization can input data and that it will be captured weekly. In this application the users can view the weekly average at a push of a button, as well as see detailed information about this week's weather conditions that was recorded. It consists of three screens, which each of them has their very own purpose. This application is for all ages and can be used in education and in general life, to know the weather.

This application is very much needed in today's time, as all things are becoming digitalized, not to mention this application is specific to a local weather organization. This means weather experts can input data directly into the application to capture it, and users will also be able to view it weekly. When using the application on an Android device, professionals or even users will be able to give input about the day's minimum and maximum temperatures, they will be able see the weeks average, based on the input received. 
All the input throughout the week is captured by just a push of a button, the same when the average is being displayed... just one push of a button. The user can also clear all information gathered every end of the week to start fresh. There is also flawless navigation at the bottom of the screens using buttons. The detailed view can be seen on the last screen of the application, which the user can then navigate back to the main screen and exit the application.

Android 8.0 ("Oreo") | x86


GitHub Utilization
As we needed to push our code to GitHub follow the steps of:
1. Make a repository, which is initialized with a README file.
2. Then pushing my Android Application from Android studio to GitHub, through the file management. Opening the application file 
a. At the top where path is show, click file, type CMD
b. git init
c. git add .
d. git commit -m "first commit"
e. git branch -M main
f. git remote add origin repository URL
g. git push -u origin main
As seen, I did push my application file to the main branch. I did push successfully.

GitHub Actions
Testing was carried out manually in Android Studio. The workflows were established.
* In order to verify the functionality of the application.
* In order to construct the application.
The codes are located in the workflows folder of the main branch on the GitHub repository.
